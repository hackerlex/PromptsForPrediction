# IPL Prompt Forecasting (AI-Powered Sports Insight)

A fun and educational experiment blending prompt engineering, sports forecasting, and data reasoning ‚Äî inspired by IPL cricket matches. Ideal for tech folks, data enthusiasts, and AI prompt lovers who want to simulate outcome prediction scenarios based on real-world datasets.

---

## üìå Objective

Use AI prompt frameworks to assess different levels of predictive scenarios in IPL matches. Apply structured thinking to sports data ‚Äî without promoting betting or gambling.

---

## üîç Prompt Styles

### ‚úÖ 1. Low-Risk Forecast (Play it safe - For the ones playing it cooler than a hacker in DEFCON hoodie)

Use for simple, frequently occurring events.

üß† Prompt:

```txt
"[Insert Chances Here] ‚Äî Analyze the statistical probability of this outcome based on recent team performance, pitch behavior, and player form. Is this a low-risk, high-consistency prediction worth considering?"
```

Use Cases:

* Total runs under 6.5 in 1st over
* First ball to be a dot delivery
* Innings total under 160

### ‚öñÔ∏è 2. Mid-Risk Forecast (Balanced Insights - Like trying an exploit in prod but you‚Äôve done your recon)

Explore valuable opportunities based on player/team form and historical outcomes.

üß† Prompt:

```txt
"[Insert Chances Here] ‚Äî Evaluate this outcome based on head-to-head history, current match momentum, and statistical odds. Does it present a reasonable risk-to-reward ratio?"
```

Use Cases:

* A batsman scoring 50+
* Team to take 4+ wickets
* Toss + match result combo

### üéØ 3. High-Risk, High-Yield Prediction (For advanced simulation - Aka YOLO mode ‚Äî Metasploit meets match chaos)

Use where the odds are low but the return or insight is interesting.

üß† Prompt:

```txt
"[Insert Chances Here] ‚Äî Considering the low probability but high return, what‚Äôs the realistic likelihood of this outcome based on upset patterns, player volatility, and match-day surprises?"
```

Use Cases:

* Super Over scenario
* Batsman to score 100+
* First wicket LBW or Run Out

## üìà Sample Input (Real-World Use Case)

### üß™ Scenario 1: Match - Sunrisers Hyderabad vs Delhi Capitals (05.05.2025)

Sample Data Prompt:

```txt
Prediction; Sunrisers Hyderabad ‚Äì Delhi Capitals: Delhi Capitals Wicket in over 5 ‚Äì Yes  
Outcome: Win
```

üß† Prompt:

```txt
Prediction; Sunrisers Hyderabad ‚Äì Delhi Capitals: Delhi Capitals Wicket in over 5 ‚Äî Evaluate this outcome based on over-wise wicket patterns and pressure overs. What‚Äôs the probability of this occurring based on previous match breakdowns?
```

Sample Data Prompt:

```txt
Prediction; Sunrisers Hyderabad ‚Äì Delhi Capitals: Delhi Capitals Wicket in over 4 ‚Äì No  
Outcome: Win
```

üß† Prompt:

```txt
Prediction; Sunrisers Hyderabad ‚Äì Delhi Capitals: Delhi Capitals Wicket in over 4 ‚Äî Assess the probability of Delhi maintaining a wicket during this over based on past wicket falls and early over stability.
```

Sample Data Prompt:

```txt
Prediction; Sunrisers Hyderabad ‚Äì Delhi Capitals: Total runs in over 19 delivery 1, Delhi Capitals Total 3.5 ‚Äì Over  
Outcome: Win
```

üß† Prompt:

```txt
Prediction; Sunrisers Hyderabad ‚Äì Delhi Capitals: Total runs in over 19 delivery 1 ‚Äî Analyze Delhi‚Äôs end-over acceleration rate and strike rotation pattern. Are they likely to score above 3.5 on this delivery?
```

### üß™ Scenario 2: Match - Punjab Kings vs Lucknow Super Giants (04.05.2025)

Sample Data Prompt:

```txt
Prediction; Punjab Kings ‚Äì Lucknow Super Giants: Punjab Kings > 209.5 ‚Äì Yes  
Outcome: Win
```

üß† Prompt:

```txt
Prediction; Punjab Kings ‚Äì Lucknow Super Giants: Punjab Kings > 209.5 ‚Äî Evaluate the projected scoring trend for this team based on powerplay performance, death over acceleration, and past inning totals in similar conditions. Is this projection feasible?
```

Sample Data Prompt:

```txt
Prediction; Punjab Kings ‚Äì Lucknow Super Giants: Lucknow Super Giants even total in over 19 ‚Äì Yes  
Outcome: Win
```

üß† Prompt:

```txt
Prediction; Punjab Kings ‚Äì Lucknow Super Giants: Lucknow even total in over 19 ‚Äî Based on over-by-over score frequency, what are the odds of Lucknow achieving an even run count in this late over phase?
```
