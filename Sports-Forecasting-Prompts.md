# IPL Prompt Forecasting (AI-Powered Sports Insight)

A fun and educational experiment blending prompt engineering, sports forecasting, and data reasoning ‚Äî inspired by IPL cricket matches. Ideal for tech folks, data enthusiasts, and AI prompt lovers who want to simulate outcome prediction scenarios based on real-world datasets.

---

## üìå Objective

Use AI prompt frameworks to assess different levels of predictive scenarios in IPL matches. Apply structured thinking to sports data ‚Äî without promoting betting or gambling.

---

## üîç Prompt Styles

### ‚úÖ 1. Low-Risk Forecast (Play it safe - For the ones playing it cooler than a hacker in DEFCON hoodie)

Use for simple, frequently occurring events.

üß† Prompt:

```txt
"[Insert Chances Here] ‚Äî Analyze the statistical probability of this outcome based on recent team performance, pitch behavior, and player form. Is this a low-risk, high-consistency prediction worth considering?"
```

Use Cases:

* Total runs under 6.5 in 1st over
* First ball to be a dot delivery
* Innings total under 160

### ‚öñÔ∏è 2. Mid-Risk Forecast (Balanced Insights - Like trying an exploit in prod but you‚Äôve done your recon)

Explore valuable opportunities based on player/team form and historical outcomes.

üß† Prompt:

```txt
"[Insert Chances Here] ‚Äî Evaluate this outcome based on head-to-head history, current match momentum, and statistical odds. Does it present a reasonable risk-to-reward ratio?"
```

Use Cases:

* A batsman scoring 50+
* Team to take 4+ wickets
* Toss + match result combo

### üéØ 3. High-Risk, High-Yield Prediction (For advanced simulation - Aka YOLO mode ‚Äî Metasploit meets match chaos)

Use where the odds are low but the return or insight is interesting.

üß† Prompt:

```txt
"[Insert Chances Here] ‚Äî Considering the low probability but high return, what‚Äôs the realistic likelihood of this outcome based on upset patterns, player volatility, and match-day surprises?"
```

Use Cases:

* Super Over scenario
* Batsman to score 100+
* First wicket LBW or Run Out
