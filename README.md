## 🎯 Core Idea

Prompt engineering is the art of turning natural language into machine-understandable magic. This repo aims to:
- Document useful prompt formats and their results across different models
- Create a playground to tweak, test, and optimize prompts
- Develop prompt-based prediction utilities in areas like:
  - Cybersecurity
  - Threat Intelligence
  - Sentiment Analysis
  - Trend Forecasting
  - Behavior Prediction
  - Healthcare Risk Prediction
  - Financial Fraud Detection
  - Consumer Behavior & Market Risks
  - Supply Chain Disruptions
