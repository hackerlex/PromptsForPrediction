# 🚀 Welcome to PromptsForPrediction

**PromptsForPrediction** is an evolving project focused on crafting, curating, and experimenting with AI prompts for various prediction-based use cases. Think of it as your personal prompt lab where words meet models to create magic. Whether you're fine-tuning LLMs, building intelligent assistants, or doing quirky experiments — this is your sandbox!

## 🎯 Core Idea

Prompt engineering is the art of turning natural language into machine-understandable magic. This repo aims to:
- Document useful prompt formats and their results across different models
- Create a playground to tweak, test, and optimize prompts
- Develop prompt-based prediction utilities in areas like:
  - Cybersecurity
  - Threat Intelligence
  - Sentiment Analysis
  - Trend Forecasting
  - Behavior Prediction
